# AWS Cloud Practitioner GRC Labs Portfolio

Welcome to my **AWS Skills Builder Cloud Practitioner GRC Labs Portfolio**.  
This repository contains a series of 12 hands-on labs designed to strengthen my understanding of **GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance)** principles, **AWS cloud concepts**, and **compliance practices**.

> **Important:** The mapping of controls, compliance references, and associated risk insights were **not part of the original lab instructions**. These were added as part of my own initiative to demonstrate practical GRC application.

## Repository Structure


- **`docs/`**: Each lab is documented with a consistent structure including Objective, Steps, Observations, Lessons Learned, and Optional Control Mapping.  
- **`evidence/`**: Contains screenshots, diagrams, or other files for each lab to support findings and results. Each lab has its own subdirectory (`lab01` → `lab12`).

---

## Lab Documentation

Each lab in `docs/` follows this structure:

1. **Objective** – The goal of the lab.  
2. **Steps** – Actions taken to complete the lab.  
3. **Observations** – Key findings and outcomes.  
4. **Lessons Learned** – Insights gained, best practices, and relevance to GRC.  
5. **Optional Control Mapping** – My own initiative to map security and compliance controls to the scenario.

## Learning Goals

These labs are designed to achieve the following learning outcomes:

### GRC Learning Goals
- Apply GRC concepts in practical scenarios.  
- Understand risk assessment and mitigation strategies.  
- Explore compliance frameworks and shared responsibility models.  
- Document processes and insights in a structured, professional manner.  

### Cloud Learning Goals
- Understand core **AWS cloud infrastructure concepts**.  
- Gain hands-on experience with AWS services relevant to cloud security and governance.  
- Understand cloud shared responsibility and security best practices.  
- Relate cloud configurations and deployments to compliance and risk controls.

## How to Navigate

1. **Review Labs:** Open the `docs/` folder and select a lab file (e.g., `Lab-01.md`).  
2. **View Evidence:** Check the `evidence/` folder for lab-specific screenshots, diagrams, and other supporting files (`lab01` → `lab12`).  
3. **Explore Control Mapping:** Each lab may include optional control mapping, showcasing practical GRC applications.
