# AWS SimuLearn Cloud Practitioner GRC Labs Portfolio  

Welcome to my **AWS SimuLearn Cloud Practitioner / GRC Labs Portfolio**.  
This repository documents my work on **12 guided cloud labs from SimuLearn**, where I combined **AWS hands-on practice** with **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** principles.  

These labs helped me strengthen my understanding of:  
- **GRC concepts** and real-world application  
- **AWS cloud infrastructure** and the **shared responsibility model**  
- **Compliance frameworks and security controls**  

> **Note:** The original SimuLearn labs did not include compliance mapping.  
> I independently added **control mapping (ISO 27001, NIST, etc.)** to demonstrate how technical work connects to governance and risk management.

## Repository Structure  

- **`docs/`** → Lab write-ups including objectives, steps, observations, lessons learned, and optional control mapping  
- **`evidence/`** → Lab-specific folders with screenshots and diagrams that support the documentation  

---

## Lab Documentation Format  

Each lab Markdown file follows this structure:  

1. **Objective** – What the lab aims to achieve  
2. **Steps** – Actions performed in AWS  
3. **Observations** – Outcomes and key findings  
4. **Lessons Learned** – Insights gained and GRC relevance  
5. **Optional Control Mapping** – My contribution: linking security/compliance controls to the lab

## Learning Goals  

### GRC Learning Goals  
- Apply governance, risk, and compliance principles in practical AWS scenarios  
- Understand risk assessment and mitigation strategies  
- Map cloud practices to compliance frameworks (ISO 27001, NIST, etc.)  
- Develop professional, structured documentation practices  

### Cloud Learning Goals  
- Strengthen knowledge of AWS foundational services  
- Practice hands-on implementation of security and governance features  
- Explore the shared responsibility model in real cloud scenarios  
- Relate cloud configurations to compliance and risk controls

## How to Navigate the Repository  

1. **Read the Labs:** Open `docs/` and select a lab file (e.g., `Lab-01.md`)  
2. **Check Evidence:** Browse `evidence/` folders (`lab01` → `lab12`) for screenshots and diagrams  
3. **Review Control Mapping:** See how each lab ties into governance and compliance frameworks

## About Me  

I am actively building **hands-on GRC and cloud experience** and documenting it through this portfolio.  
My goal is to bridge **cloud technology** with **governance, risk, and compliance**, and showcase how technical implementation aligns with regulatory and security frameworks.
