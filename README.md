# AWS Cloud Practitioner GRC Labs Portfolio

Welcome to my **AWS Skills Builder Cloud Practitioner GRC Labs Portfolio**.  
This repository contains **12 hands-on labs** designed to strengthen my understanding of:

- **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) concepts**  
- **AWS cloud infrastructure and shared responsibility**  
- **Compliance frameworks and risk controls**  

> **Note:** The mapping of controls and compliance references were **not part of the original lab instructions**. These were added as my own initiative to demonstrate practical GRC application.

## Repository Structure


- **`docs/`**: Each lab contains objectives, steps, observations, lessons learned, and optional control mapping.  
- **`evidence/`**: Each subfolder corresponds to a lab and contains screenshots or diagrams to support the documentation.

## Lab Documentation Format

Each lab Markdown file follows this structure:

1. **Objective** – Goal of the lab  
2. **Steps** – Actions taken to complete the lab  
3. **Observations** – Key findings and outcomes  
4. **Lessons Learned** – Insights gained and GRC relevance  
5. **Optional Control Mapping** – My initiative to map security and compliance controls to the lab scenario
