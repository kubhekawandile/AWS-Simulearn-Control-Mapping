# AWS GRC Lab Portfolio

This repository documents solutions for 12 AWS labs. **Please note:** The mapping of AWS services to ISO 27001:2022 controls was **not part of the original lab requirements**. I performed this mapping independently to create a more tangible, valuable project that demonstrates both technical (AWS) and GRC expertise.

## Labs Overview
