# Evidence Folder Explanation

This folder contains supporting evidence for the 12 AWS Cloud Practitioner GRC labs.  

Each subdirectory (`lab01`, `lab02`, ..., `lab12`) includes screenshots, diagrams, or other files demonstrating the steps and outcomes of the corresponding lab in `docs/`.  

The evidence is organized per lab to make it easy to cross-reference with the lab documentation and verify practical work.  

> **Note:** This folder is for visual and supporting evidence only and does not contain lab instructions or lessons learned.
