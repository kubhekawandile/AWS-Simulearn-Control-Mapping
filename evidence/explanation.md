# Evidence Folder Explanation

This folder contains **supporting evidence** for the 12 AWS Cloud Practitioner GRC labs.  

Each subdirectory (`lab01`, `lab02`, ..., `lab12`) includes:

- Screenshots  
- Diagrams  
- Other outputs that demonstrate the steps and results for the corresponding lab in `docs/`

The evidence is organized per lab to make it easy to cross-reference with the lab documentation and verify practical work.

> **Note:** This folder is for visual and supporting evidence only and does not contain lab instructions or lessons learned.
